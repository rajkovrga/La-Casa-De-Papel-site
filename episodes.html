                    After Berlin turns Tokyo to the police for threatening him, Rio wants revenge. Now as one of the
                    hostages, Rio joins forces with Arturo in another escape plan with Mónica's help. Berlin comes
                    close to

                    By the Professor's promise that he will free Tokyo from the police, Rio rejoins the robbers and
                    helps
                    them stop Arturo's latest escape plan. Meanwhile, Raquel sets a trap for the Professor by creating
                    a
                    hoax that Ángel has awakened from his coma, in hopes it would lure him to the hospital to finish
                    him
                    off before he can identify the Professor. The Professor, sceptical of the announcement, casts
                    dozens of
                    clowns at the hospital and dresses up like one, blending in with the crowd while confirming the
                    hoax.

                    Realising that Salva is the Professor, Raquel takes him into custody and interrogates him at the
                    villa.
                    The Professor admits that he has fallen in love with her, and she performs a polygraph test on him.
                    Meanwhile, Arturo is punished for his multiple attempts to escape and Moscow reveals a secret to
                    Denver
                    that he left his mother when he was young because she was a drug addict, which creates a divide

                    father and son. While Tokyo is transported to prison, she is freed by men sent by the Professor.

                    Moscow is gravely injured by a police gunshot after helping Tokyo return to the Mint and the police
                    refuse to send aid. The robbers then rush to finish their escape tunnel. The Professor walks out of
                    the
                    villa at gunpoint by Raquel, but she is emotionally unable and unwilling to stop him from escaping.
                    Coronel Prieto, Suárez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they
                    identify
                    the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made
                    from
                    local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel. </p>

                As the police, led by Suárez, launch an attack on the Mint to liberate the hostages and capture the
                robbers, the robbers run to escape with the money they printed since the 125 hours inside the Mint,
                about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also
                less than the planned €2.4 billion, having printed €984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout
                and she is tied up. While she is there, Ángel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person.
                Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go.
