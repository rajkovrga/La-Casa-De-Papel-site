<decription> Moscow is gravely injured by a police gunshot after helping Tokyo return to the Mint and the police
                    refuse to send aid. The robbers then rush to finish their escape tunnel. The Professor walks out of
                    the
                    villa at gunpoint by Raquel, but she is emotionally unable and unwilling to stop him from escaping.
                    Coronel Prieto, Suárez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they
                    identify
                    the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made
                    from
                    local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel.</decription>

<decription> As the police, led by Suárez, launch an attack on the Mint to liberate the hostages and capture the
                robbers, the robbers run to escape with the money they printed since the 125 hours inside the Mint,
                about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also
                less than the planned €2.4 billion, having printed €984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout
                and she is tied up. While she is there, Ángel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person.
                Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go.</decription>
