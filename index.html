                <p>A mysterious man, known as "The Professor", is planning the biggest bank heist in history. To carry
                    out the ambitious plan, he recruits a team of eight people with certain abilities who have nothing
                    to lose. The goal is to enter the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, the capital of Spain, and print
                    €2.4 billion. To do this, the team requires eleven days of seclusion, during which they have to
                    deal with elite police forces and 67 hostages.</p>

                    National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters, which bears a passing resemblance to the mint in
                    Madrid.</p>
